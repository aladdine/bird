let's suppose there is (u, v) which represents same rational and v > 0, gcd(u, v) = 1, u /= x, v /= y
x / y = u / v => 
1. x = (u * y) / v, since gcd(u, v) = 1, v should devide y
2. u = (x * v) / y, since gcd(x, y) = 1, y should devide v => v == y and x == u => there is no u /= x, v /= y representing same rational nubmer
